## Note to CRAN maintainer
This is a resubmission. The previous submission from May 20
had extra README images that inadvertently inflated the package
size. Those have been removed, and README images are now placed in
`man/figures`.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
